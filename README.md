# Detecting Malicious URLs

## About The Project
This project aims to detect and categorize malicious URLs to identify the type of cyber attack they are involved in. Using advanced techniques, "Detecting Malicious URLs" stands as a frontline defense against online threats, enhancing cybersecurity measures by providing a tool to automatically detect potential online dangers.

### Problem Statement
In the digital age, the threat posed by malicious URLs in various forms of cyber attacks is ever-increasing. Existing methods to identify and categorize these threats often fall short. This project introduces a solution to accurately detect malicious URLs and determine their attack types, leveraging sophisticated algorithms and machine learning techniques.

### Key Features
- **Automated Detection**: Rapid identification of malicious URLs.
- **Attack Categorization**: Classifying the type of cyber attack associated with each URL.
- **Data Analysis**: Deep analysis of URL patterns to predict and prevent future threats.

## Built With
- Python
- Machine Learning Libraries (e.g.numpy,pandas, scikit-learn)
- Flask

## Getting Started
- 1.Navigate to the directory where you want to clone/run/save application
- 2.Clone this repository:
- 3.Navigate to the git repository
- 4.Install virtual environment
- 5.Create a virtual environment
- 6.Activate virtual environment
- 7.Install dependencies(python: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Flask)
- 8.Run app.py

### Prerequisites
-  Installing Python(python --version)
- Installing Scikit-Learn

### Using the Application
This app is meant to be used a Chrome extension to help you avoid malicious links as you surf the internet as I demonstrate below



We hope to warn users about the dangerous of visiting certain malicious websites with our application
